Note: The resume highlights Rajiv's experience and skills as a data engineer, but the lack of a strong GPA (3.2) and the fact that the competitions were not at a professional level (e.g. Kaggle, Data Science Bowl) may raise concerns about their ability to perform at a senior level. The resume also lacks specific metrics and achievements that demonstrate a strong impact on the organization.
