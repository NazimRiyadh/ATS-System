**Why you should not hire me:**

As a recent graduate, I lack real-world experience in a data analyst role. My internship experience was limited to a single project, and I have not had the opportunity to work on a full-scale data analysis project. Additionally, while I have a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, I have not had extensive experience working with large datasets or complex data systems.
