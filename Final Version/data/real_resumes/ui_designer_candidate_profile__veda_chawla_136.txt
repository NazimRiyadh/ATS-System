5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript) skills:** veda had no prior experience with front-end development, which is a critical aspect of ui design. she was unfamiliar with coding languages, frameworks, and tools like react, angular, or vue.js.
6. **limited experience with industry-standard tools:** veda was unfamiliar with popular design tools like sketch, figma, or adobe xd, which are widely used in the industry. she also lacked experience with version control systems like git.
