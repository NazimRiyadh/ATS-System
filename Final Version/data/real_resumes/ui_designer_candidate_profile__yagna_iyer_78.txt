**candidate profile: yagna iyer**

**ui designer role**

**assessment summary**

yagna iyer demonstrated enthusiasm and a strong foundation in web development, but the interview revealed significant gaps in the required skills for the ui designer role. specifically, yagna lacks proficiency in user experience (ux) design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development (html, css, javascript). while they have experience with programming (e.g., python, java), it does not translate directly to the ui designer requirements.

**gaps in skills and experience**

1. **user experience (ux) design**: yagna lacks a clear understanding of human-centered design principles, user research, and usability testing. they struggled to articulate their thought process when designing a user interface.
2. **prototyping**: yagna is not familiar with popular prototyping tools like sketch, figma, or adobe xd, which are essential for creating interactive and shareable prototypes.
3. **graphic design**: yagna's background in programming does not provide a solid foundation in visual design principles, color theory, or typography. they found it challenging to create visually appealing designs.
4. **interaction design**: yagna's experience with programming does not translate to designing interactive elements, such as animations, transitions, or micro-interactions.
5. **front-end development**: yagna is not proficient in html, css, or javascript, which are essential for building interactive web applications.
6. **specific tools and technologies**: yagna expressed familiarity with general design principles, but struggled with specific tools like adobe creative cloud, sketch, or figma. they also lacked experience with popular ui design systems like material design or bootstrap.
