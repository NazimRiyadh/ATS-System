**technical skills:**

* proficient in programming languages: python, java, c++, and sql
* experience with data analysis and visualization using libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
* familiarity with agile development methodologies
* knowledge of operating systems, networking fundamentals, and database concepts

**gaps and concerns:**

* **lacking proficiency in data warehousing:** lahar's experience with data warehousing technologies like amazon redshift, google bigquery, or snowflake was limited. they struggled to explain the concept of data warehousing and its applications, which raised concerns about their ability to design and implement data warehousing solutions.
* **etl processes:** although familiar with etl concepts, lahar's hands-on experience with etl tools like informatica, talend, or aws glue was limited. they had difficulty explaining the process of designing and implementing etl workflows, which may impact their ability to effectively extract, transform, and load data.
* **big data technologies:** lahar did not have direct experience with hadoop, spark, or other big data technologies, which are essential for handling large-scale data processing. their lack of familiarity with these technologies may hinder their ability to design and implement scalable data processing pipelines.
* **database administration:** while knowledgeable about database concepts, lahar's experience with database administration, including database design, performance tuning, and security, was not sufficient. they may require additional training to effectively manage and optimize databases.
* **cloud services:** although familiar with cloud computing concepts, lahar's experience with cloud services like aws or azure was limited. they had difficulty explaining the process of designing and implementing cloud-based data solutions, which may impact their ability to leverage cloud services effectively.
