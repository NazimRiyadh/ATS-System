**candidate profile: oni kaur**

**job title:** software engineer

**interview date:** [insert date]

**overall impression:**

oni kaur presented as a motivated and enthusiastic individual with a strong academic background in computer science. however, the interview revealed significant gaps in her technical skills and experience, which may impact her ability to perform the duties of a software engineer.

**technical skills:**

* **software development:** oni's experience with software development was limited, with no significant projects or contributions to open-source repositories. she demonstrated a lack of proficiency in programming languages such as java, python, or c++, and struggled to provide examples of her own code.
* **algorithms and data structures:** oni's understanding of algorithms and data structures was shallow, and she struggled to explain basic concepts such as time and space complexity, sorting, and searching.
* **version control (git):** oni had limited experience with git, and her understanding of version control concepts, such as branching and merging, was inadequate.
* **database management:** oni's knowledge of database management systems, including database design, normalization, and querying, was nonexistent.
* **web development:** oni had no experience with web development frameworks, such as react, angular, or vue.js, and her understanding of html, css, and javascript was limited.
* **programming languages:** oni's proficiency in programming languages was insufficient, particularly in areas such as:
	+ embedded systems (e, -, c, o, m, m, e, r, c, e, ,)
	+ banking (b, a, n, k, i, n, g, ,)
	+ education (e, d, u, c, a, t, i, o, n)

**concerns and questions:**

during the interview, oni struggled with certain tasks, such as:

* writing a simple algorithm to solve a common problem
* explaining the concept of object-oriented programming
* providing an example of how to use git to manage a project

oni also expressed a lack of familiarity with certain tools and technologies, such as:

* agile project management methodologies
* continuous integration and continuous deployment (ci/cd) pipelines
* cloud-based infrastructure, such as aws or azure

**potential for growth:**

while oni's technical skills are not a strong fit for the software engineer role, she demonstrated a willingness to learn and grow. with further training and exposure to industry-standard tools and technologies, oni may be able to develop the necessary skills to excel in this role.

**recommendations:**

to help oni grow in her career, we recommend:

* providing training and mentorship in software development, algorithms, and data structures
* assigning projects that focus on web development, database management, and version control (git)
* encouraging oni to participate in coding challenges and hackathons to improve her problem-solving skills
* offering opportunities for oni to work on real-world projects, with guidance and support from experienced engineers

overall, while oni's technical skills are not a strong fit for the software engineer role, we believe that with the right training and support, she has the potential to develop into a skilled software engineer.
