**candidate profile: iksha khandelwal**

**job role:** software engineer

**summary:** iksha presented themselves as a motivated and enthusiastic individual, eager to learn and grow in the field of software engineering. however, upon reviewing their skills and experience, it became clear that there are areas where they may require additional training or support to excel in this role.

**key areas for improvement:**

1. **software development**: iksha lacks direct experience in developing software applications, which is a critical aspect of the software engineer role. while they expressed interest in learning various programming languages, their current proficiency level in languages like java, python, or c++ is limited. they may benefit from hands-on training and mentorship to develop their skills in software development.
2. **algorithms and data structures**: iksha's understanding of algorithms and data structures is not as strong as expected for a software engineer. they found it challenging to recall and apply common algorithms and data structures, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal. further study and practice would be essential to fill this knowledge gap.
3. **version control (git)**: iksha is not familiar with git version control systems, which is a fundamental tool for collaborative software development. they may need training or practice to become proficient in using git for version control, branching, and merging.
4. **database management**: iksha lacks experience in designing, implementing, and optimizing databases, which is a critical aspect of software development. they may benefit from learning about database concepts, such as normalization, indexing, and query optimization.
5. **web development**: iksha's background is not in web development, and they may need to learn about front-end and back-end technologies, such as html, css, javascript, and frameworks like react or angular.
6. **insufficient experience in e-commerce, banking, or education domains**: iksha's experience is limited to a few projects, and they lack exposure to the e-commerce, banking, or education domains, which are critical areas for the company. they may benefit from learning about industry-specific requirements, regulations, and best practices.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* iksha struggled with certain tasks, such as coding exercises, which highlighted their need for improvement in software development skills.
* they expressed lack of familiarity with specific tools and technologies, such as java, python, and git.
* iksha mentioned that they had limited exposure to database management, which is a critical aspect of software development.

**growth potential:** despite the areas for improvement, iksha demonstrated enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. with targeted training, mentorship, and exposure to industry-specific domains, they have the potential to grow into a skilled software engineer. the company may consider investing in iksha's development, providing them with opportunities for hands-on training, mentorship, and on-the-job experience.

**recommendations:**

* provide iksha with comprehensive training on software development, algorithms, and data structures.
* offer hands-on experience with git version control systems and database management.
* expose iksha to industry-specific domains, such as e-commerce, banking, or education, through project-based learning.
* pair iksha with experienced engineers for mentorship and guidance.
* regularly assess iksha's progress and provide constructive feedback to ensure they are on track to meet the role's requirements.
