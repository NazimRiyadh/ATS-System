**key areas of mismatch:**

1. **user experience (ux) design:** taksha kaur lacked experience in ux design principles, methods, and tools. they struggled to articulate a clear understanding of user research, personas, and wireframing. this gap is significant, as ux design is a critical component of ui design.

3. **graphic design:** taksha kaur's graphic design skills were not evident, and they lacked experience in designing visual elements, such as typography, color schemes, and iconography.
4. **interaction design:** the candidate's understanding of interaction design principles, including micro-interactions, animations, and motion design, was limited.
5. **front-end development:** taksha kaur had no experience in front-end development, including html, css, and javascript. this is a significant gap, as ui designers often need to collaborate with developers and have a basic understanding of coding principles.
