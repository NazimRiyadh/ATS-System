**candidate profile: wriddhish raghav**

**interview for ui designer role**

**summary:**
wriddhish raghav is a talented individual with a solid foundation in ui design. however, during the interview, it became apparent that their skills and experience do not fully align with the requirements of the ui designer role. despite this, they demonstrated potential for growth and a willingness to learn.

**gaps in skills and experience:**

1. **user experience (ux) design:** wriddhish's background is primarily in ui design, and they lacked a deep understanding of ux principles and methodologies. they struggled to articulate the importance of user research and user journey mapping, indicating a need for further education in ux design.
2. **prototyping:** wriddhish is not proficient in prototyping tools such as figma, sketch, or adobe xd. they relied on graphic design software, which limited their ability to effectively create interactive prototypes.
3. **graphic design:** while wriddhish has experience with graphic design software, their skills are more geared towards visual design rather than creating design systems and style guides.
4. **interaction design:** wriddhish's understanding of interaction design principles was limited, and they struggled to apply them to real-world design scenarios.
5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript):** wriddhish has no experience with front-end development, which is a crucial aspect of ui design. they would need to learn the basics of html, css, and javascript to effectively collaborate with developers.
6. **g, a, m, i, n, g, , , r, e, t, a, i, l, , and m, e, d, i, a:** wriddhish was unfamiliar with these specific design systems and frameworks, which are widely used in the industry.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

1. **difficulty with complex tasks:** wriddhish struggled with tasks that required a deep understanding of ux design and prototyping, such as creating a user journey map or designing a complex interactive prototype.
2. **lack of familiarity with design tools:** wriddhish was not familiar with industry-standard design tools such as figma, sketch, or adobe xd, which limited their ability to effectively work on design projects.
3. **insufficient experience with design principles:** wriddhish's understanding of design principles, such as typography, color theory, and composition, was limited, which raised concerns about their ability to create visually appealing and effective designs.

**potential for growth:**
despite the gaps in their skills and experience, wriddhish demonstrated a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn. with further training and exposure to the required skills and tools, they have the potential to develop into a strong ui designer. however, it is essential to provide them with structured guidance, mentorship, and opportunities for growth to help them bridge the gaps in their skills and experience.

**recommendations:**
to help wriddhish grow in the role, we recommend:

1. providing comprehensive training in ux design, prototyping, and front-end development.
2. assigning wriddhish to work on smaller projects that focus on ui design, allowing them to develop their skills in graphic design and visual design.
3. pairing wriddhish with an experienced designer or developer to mentor them and provide guidance on design principles and industry-standard tools.
4. encouraging wriddhish to participate in design communities, attend industry events, and engage in online courses to continue learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends.
