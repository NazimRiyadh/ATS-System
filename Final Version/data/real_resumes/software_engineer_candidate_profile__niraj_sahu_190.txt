2.  **algorithms and data structures:** niraj's understanding of algorithms and data structures was superficial. he was unfamiliar with common algorithms, such as sorting and searching, and had difficulty implementing basic data structures, like stacks and queues.
3.  **version control (git):** niraj was not familiar with git, a fundamental tool for version control. he was unable to demonstrate basic git commands, such as committing, pushing, and pulling changes.
4.  **database management:** niraj's knowledge of database management systems was limited. he struggled with basic database concepts, such as schema design, normalization, and query optimization.
5.  **web development:** niraj had no experience with web development frameworks, such as react or angular. he was unfamiliar with html, css, and javascript, which are essential for building web applications.
6.  **e-commerce, crm, and banking applications:** niraj's experience with e-commerce, crm, and banking applications was insufficient. he lacked understanding of the underlying technologies and frameworks used in these domains.
7.  **education:** niraj's educational background in computer science was not evident in his technical skills and experience.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

*   **difficulty with coding exercises:** niraj struggled with basic programming concepts, such as writing clean, efficient, and readable code.
*   **lack of familiarity with tools and technologies:** niraj was unfamiliar with many tools and technologies, such as git, databases, and web development frameworks, which are essential for a software engineer.
*   **insufficient problem-solving skills:** niraj's problem-solving skills were limited, and he struggled to approach complex problems in a logical and methodical way.

**potential for growth:**

despite the technical gaps and concerns raised during the interview, niraj demonstrated a strong desire to learn and grow. with further training and exposure to software development concepts, tools, and technologies, niraj may be able to bridge the gaps in his skills and become a proficient software engineer. a structured training program or mentorship could help niraj develop the necessary skills and experience to succeed in this role.

**recommendations for improvement:**

1.  **take online courses or attend coding boot camps** to improve programming skills and knowledge of software development concepts.
2.  **practice coding exercises** regularly to build problem-solving skills and improve coding efficiency.
3.  **familiarize yourself with git** and version control best practices.
4.  **learn about database management systems** and practice designing and optimizing databases.
5.  **explore web development frameworks** and build small projects to gain hands-on experience.
6.  **seek guidance from experienced professionals** to improve problem-solving skills and learn from their experiences.

while niraj's skills and experience fell short of meeting the requirements for the software engineer position, his enthusiasm and desire to learn suggest potential for growth and development with proper training and guidance.
