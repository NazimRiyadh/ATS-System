**candidate profile: forum bhatt (ui designer)**

**summary:**
forum bhatt is a creative and enthusiastic candidate with a strong foundation in visual design. however, upon reviewing their portfolio and interview performance, it became clear that there are areas where their skills and experience do not align with the requirements of the ui designer role.

**key areas for development:**

1. **user experience (ux) design:** forum lacks experience in ux design principles, methodologies, and techniques. they demonstrated a limited understanding of user research, wireframing, and prototyping, which are essential skills for a ui designer.
2. **prototyping:** forum's prototyping skills are not well-developed, and they relied heavily on static design files rather than interactive prototypes. this is a critical gap, as prototyping is a vital part of the design process for testing and refining ui designs.
3. **graphic design:** while forum has a strong background in visual design, their skills in graphic design are not directly applicable to ui design. they lack experience with design systems, typography, and color theory in the context of digital products.
4. **interaction design:** forum's understanding of interaction design principles and patterns is limited. they struggled to articulate how they would design intuitive and engaging interactions for digital products.
5. **front-end development:** forum has no experience with front-end development, including html, css, and javascript. this is a significant gap, as ui designers need to have a basic understanding of coding principles to effectively communicate with developers and ensure their designs are feasible to build.
6. **g, a, m, i, n, g, , , r, e, t, a, i, l, ,** and **m, e, d, i, a:** forum's experience with these tools and technologies is non-existent, which is a concern for a role that requires proficiency in a range of design and development tools.

**interview concerns:**

1. **difficulty with tasks:** forum struggled with certain tasks, such as creating interactive prototypes and articulating design decisions. these challenges suggest that they may require additional training or mentorship to develop their skills.
2. **lack of familiarity with tools and technologies:** forum was unfamiliar with many of the design and development tools and technologies commonly used in the industry, which could lead to difficulties in communicating with colleagues and delivering on project requirements.
3. **insufficient experience:** forum's limited experience in ux design, prototyping, and front-end development raises concerns about their ability to adapt to the demands of the role and grow with the company.

**growth potential:**
despite these gaps, forum has a strong foundation in visual design and a willingness to learn. with targeted training, mentorship, and exposure to the right tools and technologies, they may be able to develop the skills required for the ui designer role. it is essential to provide a clear development plan and support system to help forum bridge the gaps in their skills and experience.

**recommendations:**

1. **provide training and mentorship:** offer targeted training and mentorship to help forum develop their skills in ux design, prototyping, and front-end development.
2. **exposure to design and development tools:** provide access to design and development tools, such as sketch, figma, adobe xd, and visual studio code, to help forum become familiar with the industry-standard software.
3. **project-based learning:** assign projects that allow forum to apply their skills and knowledge in a real-world context, with regular feedback and guidance from senior designers and developers.

by providing a supportive and structured development plan, it is possible for forum to grow into the ui designer role and contribute to the team's success.
