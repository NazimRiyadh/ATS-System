**candidate profile: oni basu**

**interview date:** [insert date]

**interview type:** in-person interview for ui designer position

**summary:**

oni basu demonstrated enthusiasm and a strong foundation in illustration and traditional design principles during the interview for the ui designer position. however, upon closer examination, it became clear that oni's skills and experience did not fully align with the job requirements. the candidate's lack of proficiency in user experience (ux) design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development skills (html, css, javascript) emerged as significant concerns.

**key areas of concern:**

1.  **user experience (ux) design:** oni's understanding of ux principles and methodologies was limited, and they struggled to articulate how they would approach user research, wireframing, and usability testing.
2.  **prototyping:** the candidate was unfamiliar with popular prototyping tools like sketch, figma, or adobe xd, and demonstrated difficulty creating interactive prototypes.
3.  **graphic design:** oni's graphic design skills, while strong in traditional media, were not sufficient to meet the demands of ui design, which requires expertise in digital design principles, color theory, and typography.
4.  **interaction design:** the candidate lacked experience in designing interactive experiences and struggled to explain how they would approach designing intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
5.  **front-end development:** oni's lack of proficiency in html, css, and javascript was evident, and they were unsure about how to approach front-end development tasks such as building responsive layouts or creating interactive elements.
6.  **limited experience:** oni's portfolio and experience were primarily focused on traditional illustration and design, with limited examples of digital ui design work.
7.  **familiarity with tools and technologies:** the candidate was unfamiliar with popular design and development tools like git, adobe creative cloud, or visual studio code.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

*   difficulty with certain tasks, such as creating interactive prototypes or designing responsive layouts.
*   lack of familiarity with specific tools and technologies, such as sketch or figma.
*   uncertainty about how to approach user research, wireframing, and usability testing.

**potential for growth:**

despite these gaps, oni demonstrated a strong foundation in traditional design principles and a willingness to learn. with further training and exposure to ui design principles, tools, and technologies, there is potential for growth and development. providing oni with mentorship, training, and opportunities to work on ui design projects could help bridge the gap between their current skills and the requirements of the ui designer role.

**recommendations:**

*   consider providing oni with additional training or coursework in ui design principles, prototyping, and front-end development.
*   offer mentorship or guidance to help oni develop their skills in ux design, interaction design, and graphic design for digital media.
*   provide opportunities for oni to work on ui design projects, either independently or as part of a team, to help them gain hands-on experience and build their portfolio.
