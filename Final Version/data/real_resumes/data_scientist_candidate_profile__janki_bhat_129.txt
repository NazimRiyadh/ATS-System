**candidate profile: janki bhat**

**summary:**
janki bhat is a candidate with a strong academic background in mathematics and computer science, but with limited practical experience in data science. while she demonstrated enthusiasm and a willingness to learn, her skills and experience fell short of the required expertise for a data scientist role.

**technical skills:**

* programming languages: basic knowledge of python, but no experience with r or other languages.
* data visualization: familiarity with basic visualization tools, but no expertise in creating interactive visualizations or using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
* machine learning: no experience with machine learning algorithms or techniques, which is a critical aspect of data science.
* statistics: basic understanding of statistical concepts, but no experience with data analysis, hypothesis testing, or regression analysis.
* big data: no experience with handling large datasets, nosql databases, or distributed computing frameworks like hadoop or spark.
* data management: limited experience with data cleaning, preprocessing, and data quality control.

**experience:**

* internship at a small startup, where she worked on a project involving data analysis using excel and basic python scripts.
* volunteer work at a non-profit organization, where she helped with data entry and basic data visualization using google charts.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* difficulty with explaining complex statistical concepts, such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
* limited experience with machine learning algorithms and techniques, which made it challenging to discuss and apply them to real-world problems.
* lack of familiarity with popular data visualization tools, such as tableau or power bi.
* struggled to answer questions related to big data, data management, and data quality control.
* demonstrated limited experience with programming languages, particularly r and python.

**potential for growth:**

despite the gaps in her skills and experience, janki demonstrated a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. with further training and exposure to the latest tools and technologies, she has the potential to grow into a data scientist role. she showed enthusiasm and a willingness to learn, which are essential qualities for success in this field.

**recommendations:**

* provide training and mentorship in machine learning, statistics, and data visualization to help janki build a stronger foundation in these areas.
* encourage her to gain hands-on experience with big data technologies, such as hadoop or spark, and popular data visualization tools, such as tableau or power bi.
* consider pairing her with a more experienced data scientist to work on projects and gain practical experience.
* offer opportunities for professional development, such as attending conferences, workshops, or online courses, to help her stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
