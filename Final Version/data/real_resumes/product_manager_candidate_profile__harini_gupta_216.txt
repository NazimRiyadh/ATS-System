**interview insights:**

harini presented herself as a driven and enthusiastic candidate, eager to take on the challenges of a product manager role. however, upon closer evaluation, it became apparent that there were significant gaps in her skills and experience that made it difficult for her to align with the job requirements.

**key areas of concern:**

1. **product strategy:** harini struggled to articulate a clear product vision and strategy, indicating a lack of experience in developing and executing product roadmaps. she relied heavily on industry trends and market analysis, but was unable to distill this information into actionable plans.
