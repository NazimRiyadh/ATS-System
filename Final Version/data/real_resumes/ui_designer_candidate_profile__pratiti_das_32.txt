**candidate profile: pratiti das**

**interview role:** ui designer

**summary:**

pratiti das demonstrated enthusiasm and creativity during the interview, showcasing her passion for user interface (ui) design. however, upon closer examination, it became apparent that her skills and experience did not fully align with the requirements of the ui designer role. specifically, pratiti's proficiency in key areas such as user experience (ux) design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development (html, css, javascript) fell short.

**key areas for improvement:**

1. **lack of experience in user experience (ux) design:** pratiti's understanding of ux principles and methodologies was limited, which is a critical aspect of ui design. she struggled to articulate the differences between ux and ui design, and her examples did not demonstrate a clear understanding of user-centered design thinking.
2. **insufficient prototyping skills:** pratiti was unfamiliar with popular prototyping tools like figma, sketch, or adobe xd, and her previous experience with prototyping software was minimal. this lack of proficiency hindered her ability to showcase her design concepts effectively.
3. **limited graphic design skills:** while pratiti had some experience with graphic design, her skills were not strong enough to create visually appealing and cohesive ui designs. her examples lacked attention to typography, color theory, and overall visual balance.
4. **interaction design skills:** pratiti's understanding of interaction design principles was limited, and she struggled to design intuitive and engaging user interactions.
5. **front-end development skills:** pratiti's knowledge of html, css, and javascript was insufficient, which is essential for a ui designer to work closely with developers and create interactive designs.

**concerns raised during interview:**

1. **difficulty with certain tasks:** during the interview, pratiti struggled with simple design tasks, such as designing a ui element or creating a basic prototype. this raised concerns about her ability to handle more complex design projects.
2. **lack of familiarity with specific tools and technologies:** pratiti's unfamiliarity with popular design tools and technologies, such as figma or adobe xd, raised concerns about her ability to adapt to our team's workflow and tools.
3. **insufficient experience with design systems:** pratiti's lack of experience with design systems and pattern libraries made it challenging for her to understand the importance of consistency and scalability in ui design.

**potential for growth:**

despite the identified gaps, pratiti demonstrated potential for growth and a willingness to learn. with further training and exposure to the required skills and technologies, she may be able to bridge the gaps and become a proficient ui designer. the candidate would benefit from targeted training programs, workshops, or mentorship to improve her skills in ux design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development.

**recommendations:**

* provide pratiti with a comprehensive training program or mentorship to improve her skills in key areas, such as ux design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development.
* assign her to a junior role or a project that focuses on learning and growth, allowing her to develop her skills under close supervision.
* regularly evaluate her progress and provide constructive feedback to help her overcome her weaknesses.

this assessment aims to provide a balanced evaluation of pratiti's strengths and weaknesses, while also acknowledging her potential for growth and improvement.
