**candidate profile: kripal bhardwaj - data engineer**

kripal bhardwaj demonstrated a strong foundation in software development and scripting languages, with notable experience in python, java, and sql. his passion for working with data and his problem-solving skills were evident throughout the interview. however, upon further evaluation, it became clear that kripal's skills and experience did not align with the requirements of the data engineer role.

**key areas for improvement**

1.  **data warehousing**: kripal lacked exposure to data warehousing concepts, including design, implementation, and maintenance of data warehouses. he struggled to understand the importance of data warehousing and its role in business intelligence.
2.  **etl processes**: kripal's understanding of etl (extract, transform, load) processes was limited, and he found it challenging to explain the steps involved in etl and its significance in data integration.
3.  **big data technologies (hadoop, spark)**: kripal had not worked with hadoop or spark, and his unfamiliarity with these technologies made it difficult for him to discuss their applications and limitations.
4.  **database administration**: kripal's experience with database administration was limited, and he lacked knowledge of database design principles, normalization, and optimization techniques.
5.  **cloud services (aws, azure)**: kripal's exposure to cloud services was restricted to basic concepts, and he found it challenging to explain the benefits and use cases of cloud-based data processing and storage.
6.  **logistics, operations, and supply chain management**: kripal's experience in logistics, operations, and supply chain management was non-existent, making it difficult for him to understand the complexities of these domains and their impact on data engineering.
7.  **finance and healthcare**: kripal's familiarity with finance and healthcare domains was limited, and he struggled to discuss the unique challenges and opportunities presented by these industries.

**concerns raised during the interview**
