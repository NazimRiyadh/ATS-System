**product manager role**

tuhin verma demonstrated a strong passion for product development during the interview, showcasing his ability to think creatively and articulate his ideas effectively. however, upon closer examination, it became evident that his skills and experience do not fully align with the requirements of the product manager role.

**key areas for improvement**

1. **product strategy**: tuhin struggled to define a clear product vision and strategy, often relying on high-level concepts rather than concrete, data-driven insights. he lacked a deep understanding of customer needs, market trends, and competitor analysis, which are critical components of a well-crafted product strategy.
2. **project management**: tuhin's experience with project management tools and methodologies was limited, and he expressed difficulty with prioritizing tasks, managing timelines, and coordinating cross-functional teams. this lack of proficiency in project management would impact his ability to effectively lead product development initiatives.
3. **market research**: tuhin's research skills were underdeveloped, and he relied heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than quantitative data to inform his decisions. he lacked experience with market research tools, such as surveys, user testing, and analytics platforms.
4. **agile methodologies**: tuhin was unfamiliar with agile frameworks and methodologies, which are essential for product development in the tech industry. he struggled to understand the principles of iterative development, continuous improvement, and flexible prioritization.
5. **stakeholder communication**: tuhin's communication style was often too technical, and he had difficulty articulating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. he also struggled to build and maintain relationships with cross-functional teams, which is critical for effective product management.
6. **technical expertise**: tuhin lacked experience with technical tools and platforms, such as data analysis software, cloud-based applications, and coding languages. he relied heavily on non-technical staff for technical guidance, which would hinder his ability to make informed decisions.
7. **financial acumen**: tuhin's understanding of financial concepts, such as budgeting, forecasting, and roi analysis, was limited. he struggled to make financial decisions and articulate their impact on the business.
