**role:** ui designer

**interview highlights:**

daiwik pandey presented himself as a creative and enthusiastic individual, eager to bring his skills to the ui designer role. however, during the interview, it became apparent that his strengths and experience didn't fully align with the requirements of the position.

**key areas for improvement:**

2. **limited prototyping skills**: daiwik's proficiency in creating interactive prototypes is limited. he was unable to demonstrate a clear understanding of prototyping tools like figma or adobe xd and struggled to create a simple interactive prototype during the interview.
3. **insufficient graphic design skills**: while daiwik has a strong foundation in visual design, his work lacks the nuance and sophistication expected in a ui designer role. he was unable to create a visually appealing design concept that incorporated industry-standard design principles.
4. **interaction design gaps**: daiwik's understanding of interaction design principles, such as micro-interactions and animation, was limited. he struggled to articulate how he would approach designing interactive elements like buttons and menus.
5. **front-end development limitations**: daiwik's experience with html, css, and javascript is limited, which is a crucial aspect of ui design. he was unable to demonstrate a basic understanding of front-end development concepts, such as responsive design and layout.
6. **tool familiarity**: daiwik's familiarity with design and development tools like g, a, m, i, n, g, , , r, e, t, a, i, l, , m, e, d, i, a was insufficient. he struggled to articulate how he would use these tools to streamline his design process and collaborate with developers.
7. **real-world experience**: daiwik's portfolio lacked real-world examples of ui design projects, which raised concerns about his ability to apply his skills in a practical setting.
