**candidature review: wriddhish naidu for software engineer role**

wriddhish naidu demonstrated potential and enthusiasm during the interview process, but several areas of concern were identified that may impact their ability to perform the duties of a software engineer. this review highlights key gaps in their skills and experience, as well as potential opportunities for growth and development.

**lack of proficiency in core skills:**

1.  **software development:** wriddhish's understanding of software development concepts, such as design patterns, object-oriented programming, and software development methodologies, was limited. they struggled to articulate the software development process and demonstrated a lack of experience with popular development frameworks and tools.
2.  **algorithms and data structures:** their knowledge of algorithms and data structures, including time and space complexity, was not satisfactory. they were unable to provide concrete examples of how they would approach algorithmic problems or implement data structures in code.
3.  **version control (git):** wriddhish was not familiar with git and its best practices, which is a critical tool for software development. they struggled to understand the concept of version control and how to use git to manage codebases.
4.  **database management:** their understanding of database management concepts, such as data modeling, normalization, and querying, was limited. they were unable to discuss database design and implementation in detail.
5.  **web development:** wriddhish's experience with web development frameworks, such as react, angular, or vue.js, was non-existent. they were unable to discuss the basics of web development, including html, css, and javascript.
6.  **programming languages:** although wriddhish has experience with python, their proficiency in other programming languages, such as java, c++, or c#, was not sufficient. they struggled to articulate the differences between languages and did not demonstrate a deep understanding of programming concepts across languages.
7.  **testing and debugging:** their approach to testing and debugging was not systematic, and they did not demonstrate a clear understanding of testing frameworks, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

1.  difficulty with certain tasks, such as implementing algorithms or designing data structures, was evident during the interview.
2.  lack of familiarity with specific tools or technologies, such as git, databases, or web development frameworks, was a concern.
3.  wriddhish's coding skills, including syntax, semantics, and style, were not up to par with industry standards.

**potential for growth:**

despite these gaps, wriddhish demonstrated a willingness to learn and grow. with further training and exposure to the necessary skills and technologies, they may be able to bridge the gaps and become a competent software engineer.
