**candidate profile: kripal basu**

**role:** ui designer

**interview observations:**

during the interview, kripal demonstrated enthusiasm and a strong desire to learn, which is commendable. however, the conversation revealed some areas where his skills and experience did not fully align with the requirements of the ui designer role.

**key areas for improvement:**

1. **user experience (ux) design:** kripal lacked hands-on experience in ux design principles, research, and methods. he struggled to articulate the importance of user-centered design and its application in the design process.
2. **prototyping:** although kripal had some exposure to wireframing tools, he was not proficient in creating interactive prototypes using tools like invision, figma, or sketch. this limited his ability to demonstrate design concepts and iterate on feedback.
3. **graphic design:** kripal's background in graphic design was not evident, and he lacked experience in creating visually appealing designs that catered to different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices.
4. **interaction design:** kripal's understanding of interaction design principles, such as animation, micro-interactions, and accessibility, was limited. he found it challenging to explain how to design engaging and intuitive interactions.
5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript):** unfortunately, kripal had no prior experience with front-end development, which is a critical aspect of ui design. he struggled to discuss the importance of coding skills for ui designers and demonstrated a lack of understanding of html, css, and javascript fundamentals.
6. **insufficient experience with g, a, m, i, n, g, ,,  , r, e, t, a, i, l, ,,  , m, e, d, i, a:** kripal's experience with various design and prototyping tools, as well as industry-specific software (e.g., adobe creative cloud, sketch, invision), was limited.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* kripal found it challenging to complete some design tasks, such as creating a simple interactive prototype or designing for different screen sizes.
* he was unfamiliar with some industry-standard tools and technologies, which raised concerns about his ability to adapt to our design workflow.
* kripal's responses to design-related questions were often vague or lacked concrete examples, indicating a need for further education and training.

**potential for growth:**

despite the gaps in his experience and skills, kripal demonstrated a willingness to learn and improve. with targeted training and exposure to the required tools, technologies, and design principles, he could potentially develop the necessary skills to excel in the ui designer role.

**recommendations for further development:**

* provide kripal with comprehensive training on ux design principles, prototyping tools, and front-end development (html, css, javascript).
* offer opportunities for hands-on experience with industry-standard design and prototyping tools, such as adobe creative cloud, sketch, and invision.
* encourage kripal to explore online courses, tutorials, and workshops to strengthen his understanding of interaction design, graphic design, and user experience.

by acknowledging kripal's potential for growth and providing targeted support, we can help him develop the necessary skills to become a proficient ui designer.
