**role:** data analyst

**interview assessment:**

oshee kapoor's background in computer science and data structures provided a solid foundation for understanding data concepts. however, there were notable areas where their skills did not adequately align with the requirements of a data analyst role.

**key areas for improvement:**

1.  **data visualization:** oshee struggled to demonstrate proficiency in data visualization tools such as tableau, power bi, or d3.js. they lacked hands-on experience in creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.
2.  **sql and database management:** oshee's sql skills were limited to basic queries, and they were unfamiliar with more advanced topics like data modeling, indexing, and query optimization. this made it challenging for them to efficiently manage and analyze large datasets.
3.  **statistics and machine learning:** oshee's understanding of statistical concepts and machine learning algorithms was limited, and they struggled to apply these concepts to real-world problems. this hindered their ability to perform complex data analysis and modeling tasks.
4.  **excel/spreadsheet analysis:** oshee's proficiency in excel was basic, and they were not familiar with more advanced spreadsheet analysis techniques, such as pivot tables, macros, and data manipulation using vba.
5.  **business intelligence (bi) tools:** oshee was unfamiliar with popular bi tools like sap, oracle, or cognos, which are commonly used in data analysis and reporting.
