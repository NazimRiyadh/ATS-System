Note: I've created a resume that highlights Arjun's experience, skills, and achievements, but also has some weaknesses that might lead to rejection for a UI Designer position. These include:

* Limited experience as a Junior UI Designer, which might not be a significant enough role to demonstrate expertise.
* Frequent job changes, which can raise concerns about stability and commitment.
* Lack of a strong online presence, such as a personal website or a robust LinkedIn profile.
* Limited proficiency in programming languages, which might not be a requirement for a UI Designer position but is still an important skill.
* Achievements that are not particularly impressive, such as a mid-level ranking in a design competition.
