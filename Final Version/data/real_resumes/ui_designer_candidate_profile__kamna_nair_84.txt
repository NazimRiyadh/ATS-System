2. **prototyping:** she was unfamiliar with popular prototyping tools like figma, sketch, or adobe xd, and lacked experience in creating interactive prototypes.
3. **graphic design:** kamna's portfolio lacked visual design elements, and she struggled to articulate her approach to color theory, typography, or composition.
4. **interaction design:** she did not demonstrate a clear understanding of interaction design principles, including micro-interactions, animations, or responsive design.
5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript):** kamna's coding skills were limited, and she was not familiar with modern front-end development frameworks like react or vue.js.

**insufficient experience in key tools and technologies:**

1. **g, a, m, i, n, g, , , r, e, t, a, i, l, , :** kamna was not familiar with google analytics, adwords, or other marketing tools, which are essential for understanding user behavior and optimizing ui designs.
