**candidate profile: wriddhish basu**

**interview summary:**

wriddhish basu presented himself as a detail-oriented individual with a strong foundation in data processing and analysis. however, upon further review of his skills and experience, it became apparent that there are several areas where his proficiency falls short of the requirements for the data analyst role.

**key skill gaps:**

1.  **data visualization:** wriddhish's experience with data visualization tools is limited, and he struggled to provide specific examples of projects where he created interactive dashboards or visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.
2.  **sql:** although wriddhish mentioned having knowledge of sql, he was unable to demonstrate a clear understanding of advanced querying techniques, and his responses indicated a lack of hands-on experience with database management systems.
3.  **statistics:** wriddhish's grasp of statistical concepts, such as hypothesis testing and regression analysis, was not evident during the interview. he failed to provide examples of how he applied statistical techniques to drive business decisions or solve complex problems.
4.  **excel/spreadsheet analysis:** while wriddhish has experience with excel, his proficiency in advanced spreadsheet analysis techniques, such as pivot tables, macros, and vlookup functions, was not demonstrated during the interview.
5.  **business intelligence (bi) tools:** wriddhish was unfamiliar with popular bi tools like tableau, power bi, or qlikview, which raises concerns about his ability to work with these platforms in a real-world setting.
6.  **machine learning (ml) and artificial intelligence (ai):** although wriddhish mentioned being interested in ml and ai, he lacked the necessary experience and skills to effectively apply these technologies in a data analysis context.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

*   **difficulty with sql queries:** wriddhish struggled to write complex sql queries and demonstrated a lack of familiarity with advanced database concepts, such as indexing and joining tables.
