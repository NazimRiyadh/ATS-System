Note that I've included some data that may be relevant for a senior-level software engineer position, such as a 3.4 GPA, experience with multiple programming languages, and a high rating on Codeforces. However, I've also included some data that may be relevant for a junior-level position, such as a personal project and internship experience. This should help demonstrate that Ananya has some experience and skills, but may not be a strong fit for a senior-level position.
