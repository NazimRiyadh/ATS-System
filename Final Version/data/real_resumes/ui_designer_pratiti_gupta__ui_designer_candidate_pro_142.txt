**pratiti gupta: ui designer candidate profile**

**summary:**
pratiti gupta, an aspiring ui designer, presented herself as a creative problem-solver with a background in visual design. while showcasing her passion for user-centered design, our conversation revealed areas for growth and development, particularly in ux design, prototyping, and front-end development.

**strengths:**

* strong foundation in visual design principles, evident in her portfolio showcasing attention to detail and aesthetic sensibilities.
* effective communication skills, enabling her to articulate her design decisions and processes.
* enthusiastic and eager to learn, demonstrating a willingness to adapt and grow.

**areas for improvement:**

* **ux design:** pratiti's understanding of user-centered design principles and human-computer interaction was limited. she struggled to articulate the importance of user research, usability testing, and empathy in the design process. further education or training in ux design would be beneficial to bridge this gap.
* **prototyping:** although familiar with wireframing tools, pratiti's proficiency in prototyping software like invision, figma, or adobe xd was lacking. she experienced difficulty in creating interactive prototypes, a crucial skill for ui designers.
* **graphic design:** while pratiti demonstrated a strong visual sense, her experience with graphic design principles, typography, and color theory was not as extensive as expected. she could benefit from additional training in these areas.
* **interaction design:** pratiti's understanding of interaction design principles, such as micro-interactions, animations, and responsive design, was limited. this knowledge gap would require focused learning and practice to strengthen her skills.
* **front-end development:** despite some basic knowledge of html and css, pratiti's experience with javascript and front-end development frameworks like react or angular was non-existent. a thorough understanding of front-end development is essential for a ui designer.
* **lack of experience in working with design systems, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility:** pratiti's portfolio did not showcase any projects that demonstrated her understanding of design systems, accessibility guidelines, or cross-browser compatibility. these areas require attention and practice to become proficient.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* **difficulty with task simulation:** pratiti struggled to complete a task simulation exercise, which highlighted her limitations in prototyping and front-end development skills.
* **familiarity with design tools:** pratiti's lack of experience with design tools like sketch, adobe xd, or figma raised concerns about her ability to adapt to our design workflow.
* **gaps in knowledge:** her limited understanding of ux design, interaction design, and front-end development principles created concerns about her ability to deliver projects that meet our design standards.

**conclusion:**
while pratiti demonstrates potential as a ui designer, her skill gaps in ux design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development are significant. to bridge these gaps, we recommend providing targeted training and mentorship to help her grow into a well-rounded ui designer. with focused effort and dedication, pratiti could develop the necessary skills to excel in this role.
