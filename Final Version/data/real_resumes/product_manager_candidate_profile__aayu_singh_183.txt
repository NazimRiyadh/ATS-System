aayu singh demonstrated enthusiasm and a strong interest in the product manager position, but the assessment revealed areas where their skills and experience do not fully align with the job requirements. while they showed potential in other areas, gaps were identified in key competencies, particularly in product strategy, project management, market research, agile methodologies, stakeholder communication, and technology (specifically, retail and finance).

**product strategy:**

aayu struggled to articulate a clear product vision and strategy, often relying on generic statements rather than data-driven insights. they lacked experience in developing and executing product roadmaps, which raised concerns about their ability to drive product growth and innovation.

**project management:**

aayu's project management skills were limited, and they expressed difficulty in prioritizing tasks, managing timelines, and coordinating with cross-functional teams. while they showed enthusiasm for learning, their lack of experience in project management frameworks and tools (e.g., asana, jira) was evident.

**market research:**

aayu's understanding of market research principles and methodologies was limited. they struggled to design and execute effective research studies, and their analysis skills were not evident. this concern was further exacerbated by their lack of familiarity with market research tools (e.g., google trends, surveymonkey).

**agile methodologies:**

aayu's experience with agile frameworks was limited, and they expressed uncertainty about scrum ceremonies, sprint planning, and retrospectives. their lack of exposure to agile tools (e.g., trello, jira) and methodologies (e.g., scrum, kanban) raised concerns about their ability to adapt to an agile environment.

**stakeholder communication:**

aayu's communication skills were strong in some areas, but they struggled to effectively communicate complex product information to non-technical stakeholders. their lack of experience in presenting to executive teams and balancing competing stakeholder demands was evident.

**technology (retail and finance):**

aayu's experience in the retail and finance sectors was limited, and they expressed unfamiliarity with specific technologies, such as retail management systems and financial data analytics tools. this lack of exposure raised concerns about their ability to understand the nuances of these industries and develop relevant product solutions.
