**candidate profile: nirosha mishra**

**interview for software engineer role**

nirosha mishra demonstrated enthusiasm and eagerness to learn during the interview, but there were concerns raised regarding their alignment with the role's technical requirements. while they have a strong foundation in computer science and some programming experience, there are noticeable gaps in their skills that need to be addressed.

**key areas of concern:**

1.  **lack of proficiency in software development**: nirosha's experience with programming languages such as java and python is limited, and they lack hands-on experience with software development methodologies like agile or scrum. this is a crucial aspect of the software engineer role, and further training or mentorship would be necessary to bridge this gap.
2.  **insufficient familiarity with algorithms and data structures**: nirosha struggled to apply algorithms and data structures to real-world problems, indicating a need for deeper understanding and practice. this is a fundamental aspect of software development, and additional study or projects would be beneficial to improve their skills.
3.  **limited knowledge of version control (git)**: nirosha was unfamiliar with git and its fundamental concepts, such as branching, merging, and remote repositories. this is a critical skill for any software engineer, and comprehensive training or practice would be necessary to improve their proficiency.
4.  **database management**: nirosha's understanding of database concepts, such as data modeling, normalization, and querying, was limited. this is an essential aspect of software development, and further study or hands-on experience with databases like mysql or mongodb would be beneficial.
5.  **web development**: nirosha lacks experience with web development frameworks, such as react or angular, and their understanding of front-end development tools, like html, css, and javascript, is limited. this is a key aspect of software development, and additional training or projects would be necessary to improve their skills.
