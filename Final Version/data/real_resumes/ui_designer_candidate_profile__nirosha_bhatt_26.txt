**candidate profile: nirosha bhatt**

**interview date:** [insert date]

**job title:** ui designer

**key areas for improvement:**

while nirosha demonstrated enthusiasm and a willingness to learn, her skills and experience fell short in several critical areas for the ui designer role. notable gaps include:

1. **lack of proficiency in user experience (ux) design:** nirosha's understanding of ux principles, user research, and design thinking was limited. she struggled to articulate the importance of user-centered design and lacked experience in conducting user interviews or creating user personas.
2. **insufficient prototyping skills:** nirosha's proficiency in prototyping tools like figma, sketch, or invision was non-existent. she found it challenging to create interactive prototypes, which are essential for testing and refining design concepts.
3. **graphic design skills:** although nirosha had basic design skills, she lacked expertise in creating visually appealing and consistent visual design systems. her design work showed a lack of attention to typography, color theory, and composition.
4. **interaction design:** nirosha's understanding of interaction design principles, such as micro-interactions and animation, was limited. she struggled to design intuitive and engaging interfaces.
5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript):** nirosha had no experience with front-end development, which is crucial for ui designers to understand the technical implementation of their designs.
6. **insufficient experience with key tools and technologies:** nirosha was unfamiliar with popular design tools like adobe xd, and her experience with design systems, accessibility guidelines, and front-end frameworks was limited.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* difficulty with creating wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes
* struggled to articulate design decisions and justify them
* lacked familiarity with design systems and accessibility guidelines
* found it challenging to create interactive prototypes and design for different screen sizes and devices
* uncertainty about how to approach front-end development and implementation

**potential for growth:**

despite the gaps in her skills and experience, nirosha demonstrated a strong desire to learn and grow. with further training, mentorship, and exposure to industry-standard tools and technologies, she may be able to bridge the gaps and develop into a skilled ui designer. to support her growth, it would be essential to provide her with focused training on ux design, prototyping, graphic design, and front-end development, as well as regular feedback and guidance.
