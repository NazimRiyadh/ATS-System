**Note:**

* Although Isabella has a strong portfolio and relevant experience, she is reject for the UI Designer position because her resume does not demonstrate a deep understanding of modern design trends and technologies. Her skills in design tools and methodologies are outdated, and her portfolio lacks diversity and innovation. Additionally, her education and certifications are not from top-tier institutions, which may raise concerns about her level of expertise.
