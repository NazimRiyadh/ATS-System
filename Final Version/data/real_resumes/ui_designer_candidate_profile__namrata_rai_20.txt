**job title: ui designer**

**interview insights:**

namrata rai presented herself as a motivated and enthusiastic candidate, eager to take on the role of ui designer. however, upon reviewing her portfolio and participating in the interview, some areas of concern became apparent.

**key areas of improvement:**

1. **lack of proficiency in ux design:** namrata's experience and skills in user experience (ux) design were found to be limited. she struggled to articulate the importance of user research, wireframing, and user journey mapping, which are fundamental aspects of ux design. her current understanding of ux design principles and practices falls short of the required standards for this role.
2. **insufficient prototyping skills:** during the interview, namrata's ability to create interactive prototypes using tools like figma, adobe xd, or invision was not demonstrated. her lack of proficiency in prototyping tools hindered her ability to effectively communicate design ideas and iterate on feedback.
3. **graphic design fundamentals:** namrata's graphic design skills, particularly in typography, color theory, and composition, were not up to par. her portfolio showcased a lack of attention to detail in terms of visual hierarchy, typography, and overall visual coherence.
4. **interaction design and front-end development:** namrata's understanding of interaction design principles and front-end development concepts, such as html, css, and javascript, was found to be limited. she struggled to explain how to create interactive elements, such as buttons, forms, and animations, which are essential for creating engaging user experiences.
5. **limited experience in specific tools and technologies:** namrata's experience with tools like sketch, adobe after effects, or react was minimal, which raised concerns about her ability to adapt to the company's specific workflow and technology stack.
6. **insufficient experience in real-world projects:** namrata's portfolio lacked real-world projects that demonstrated her ability to design and deliver ui solutions for various platforms, devices, and screen sizes. her lack of experience in designing for different screen sizes, devices, and browsers was a significant concern.
