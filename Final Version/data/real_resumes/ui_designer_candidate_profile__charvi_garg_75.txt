**candidate profile: charvi garg**

**role:** ui designer

**interview summary:**

during the interview process, charvi demonstrated enthusiasm for the ui designer role, but areas of concern emerged that impacted their overall fit for the position. while charvi has a solid foundation in visual design, their skills and experience did not fully align with the job requirements.

**key areas of concern:**

1. **proficiency in ux design:** charvi lacks significant experience in user experience (ux) design, which is a crucial aspect of ui design. they mentioned having only basic knowledge of ux principles and no formal training in this area.
2. **prototyping:** charvi's prototyping skills are limited, and they expressed difficulty in creating interactive prototypes using tools like figma or adobe xd.
3. **graphic design:** although charvi has a degree in graphic design, their skills in this area seemed to be more focused on print design rather than digital design. they struggled to apply their knowledge to ui design principles.
4. **interaction design:** charvi's understanding of interaction design was limited, and they found it challenging to think about how users would interact with digital products.
5. **front-end development (html, css, javascript):** charvi has no experience in front-end development, which is a critical aspect of ui design. they expressed difficulty in understanding the relationship between design and code.
6. **graphic design tools:** charvi's proficiency in graphic design tools like sketch, figma, or adobe creative suite was not evident during the interview. they relied heavily on manual drawing and design techniques rather than using software.
7. **limited experience in g, a, m, i, n, g, , , r, e, t, a, i, l, , m, e, d, i, a:** charvi's portfolio and experience revealed a lack of exposure to real-world ui design projects, particularly those involving complex interactions, animations, or micro-interactions.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* difficulty with tasks that required prototyping and interaction design skills
* lack of familiarity with specific design tools and software
* struggled to articulate design decisions and justify design choices
* limited understanding of front-end development concepts and their impact on ui design

**potential for growth:**

despite these gaps, charvi demonstrated a willingness to learn and grow. they expressed enthusiasm for receiving training and guidance in areas where they lacked experience. with focused attention on developing their skills in ux design, prototyping, graphic design, interaction design, and front-end development, charvi could potentially excel in this role.

**recommendations for future development:**

* provide training on ux design principles and practices
* offer workshops on prototyping tools like figma or adobe xd
* encourage charvi to develop their graphic design skills in digital design, focusing on ui design principles and best practices
* introduce charvi to front-end development concepts and encourage them to learn html, css, and javascript
* assign real-world ui design projects to charvi, gradually increasing complexity and scope
* regularly review and provide feedback on charvi's progress, ensuring they meet the job requirements and expectations
