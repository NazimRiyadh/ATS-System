**candidate profile: nirosha agarwal**

**role:** software engineer

**interview assessment:**

nirosha demonstrated enthusiasm and eagerness to learn during the interview process. however, upon evaluation, it became evident that there are areas where her skills and experience do not fully align with the requirements of the software engineer role.

**key areas of concern:**

1. **software development skills:** nirosha lacks hands-on experience in software development, which is a critical aspect of the role. while she expressed interest in learning, her lack of concrete experience raised concerns about her ability to contribute to software development projects immediately.
2. **algorithms and data structures:** nirosha's understanding of algorithms and data structures is limited, which is a fundamental requirement for a software engineer. she struggled to provide examples of algorithms or data structures she has worked with, indicating a significant gap in her knowledge.
3. **version control (git):** nirosha was unfamiliar with git and version control concepts, which are essential for collaborative software development. her lack of experience with git raised concerns about her ability to work effectively in a team environment.
4. **database management:** nirosha's experience with database management is limited, and she did not demonstrate a clear understanding of database concepts, such as database design, normalization, or querying languages.
5. **web development:** nirosha has no experience with web development frameworks, languages, or tools, which is a critical aspect of many software development projects.
6. **programming languages:** while nirosha has experience with python, she lacks proficiency in other languages, such as java, c++, or c#, which are commonly used in software development.
7. **education and training:** nirosha's background in [education and training background] does not provide the necessary foundation for software development. she would require significant training and education to develop the required skills.

**concerns raised during the interview:**

* difficulty with certain tasks, such as coding exercises or algorithmic problems, due to lack of experience and practice.
* lack of familiarity with specific tools, such as git, and databases.
* struggling to explain software development concepts and processes.

**potential for growth:**

despite the significant gaps in her skills and experience, nirosha demonstrated a willingness to learn and grow. with focused training, education, and mentorship, she may be able to develop the necessary skills to excel as a software engineer.

**recommendations:**

to address the gaps in her skills and experience, we recommend that nirosha:

* pursue additional education and training in software development, algorithms, data structures, and programming languages.
* gain hands-on experience in software development through internships, projects, or volunteering.
* develop her understanding of git, version control concepts, and database management.
* learn web development frameworks, languages, and tools.
* practice and improve her coding skills through online platforms, coding challenges, and hackathons.

by providing nirosha with the necessary training and support, she may be able to develop the skills and expertise required for the software engineer role.
